<h2>Inclusion in Economics</h2>

I serve as a mentor in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/csqiep-mentoring">CSQIEP LGBTQ+ Mentorship Program</a> and the <a href="https://econmentoring.org/">Association for Mentoring and Inclusion in Economics</a>.

I used my platform to promote inclusion in college sports by organizing seminars within the Athletics Department and leading an initiative that resulted in over 150 student-athletes and staff publicly committing to supporting all Arizona Wildcats.

<p>
I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at <a href="https://www.clarku.edu/departments/economics/">Clark University</a>. I earned my PhD from the <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/econ">University of Michigan</a>, where I was a predoctoral trainee in economic demography in the <a href="https://www.psc.isr.umich.edu/">Population Studies Center</a>. My CV is <a href="https://jondentonschneider.com/files/denton-schneider_cv.pdf">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
My research is in development economics and economic history with a focus on human capital&mdash;especially health&mdash;in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. In my work, I show how <a href="https://jondentonschneider.com/files/denton-schneider_institutions_hiv.pdf">labor policies in colonial Mozambique shaped the country's HIV epidemic</a> through their lasting impacts on marriage markets. Another of my papers shows that <a href="https://jondentonschneider.com/files/denton-schneider_deworming_hiv.pdf">deworming girls in Zimbabwe reduced their HIV prevalence as young women</a>, as their improved human capital changed their marriage market outcomes. In a joint project, my co-author and I find that <a href="https://jondentonschneider.com/research">disease control has important impacts in novel domains<\a>: eliminating Chagas Disease transmission in Brazil improved labor market outcomes for adults, reduced racial disparities, and improved public finances.

<p>
I hold an MA in <a href="https://las.arizona.edu/">Latin American Studies</a> from the University of Arizona and taught Spanish while earning my degree, an experience that informs <a href="https://jondentonschneider.com/teaching">how I teach economics</a>.
</p>
    
<p>
I was also an undergraduate at Arizona, where I competed for the Men's Swimming Team as an <a href="https://jondentonschneider.com/personal">openly gay NCAA Division I student-athlete</a> and worked to increase LGBTQ inclusion in college athletics.

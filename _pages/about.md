I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://lsa.umich.edu/econ "Department of Economics") and a predoctoral trainee in economic demography in the [Population Studies Center](https://www.psc.isr.umich.edu/ "Population Studies Center") at the University of Michigan. My research is in development economics and economic history with a focus on human capital, especially health, in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America.

My job market paper shows how colonial institutions shaped the HIV epidemic in Mozambique through their lasting impacts on marriage markets. In my other research, I examine the effects of infectious disease eradication during childhood on adult income, health, labor productivity, and marriage market outcomes.

I am on the job market in 2021-22 and will be available for interviews.

I am a sixth-year PhD candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://lsa.umich.edu/econ "Department of Economics") and a predoctoral trainee in economic demography in the [Population Studies Center](https://www.psc.isr.umich.edu/ "Population Studies Center") at the University of Michigan. My research is in development economics and economic history with a focus on human capital, especially health, in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America.

My job market paper shows how colonial institutions shaped the HIV epidemic in Mozambique through their lasting impacts on marriage markets. In my other dissertation chapters, I examine the effects of infectious disease eradication during childhood on adult income, health, labor productivity, and marriage market outcomes.

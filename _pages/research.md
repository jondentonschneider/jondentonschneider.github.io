<ul>
  <li><div align="justify"><i>Abstract</i>: This paper links Africa’s history to its HIV epidemic through colonial institutions’ lasting effects on marriage markets. I exploit the arbitrary border within Mozambique between two regimes common across the continent: one that pushed over 50,000 young men annually into temporary labor migration (1897-1975) and another that heavily restricted their mobility (1891-1942). Historians contend the migrant-sending institution fundamentally altered marriage markets in that region. Using colonial census data, I show that young men there still married earlier and were closer in age to their wives two decades after the end of the mobility-restricting institution, even though migration rates had converged. Because smaller age disparities reduce HIV risk, I examine seroprevalence today and find it is nearly 50 percent (10 p.p.) lower in the former migrant-sending region. The data suggest that age disparities and associated behaviors are the main channel for this effect.</div></li>

Childhood Human Capital, Dating Markets, and HIV: Evidence from Schistosomiasis Control in Zimbabwe
  <ul>
  <li><div align="justify"><i>Abstract</i>: I examine how improving childhood health in Sub-Saharan Africa reduces young women’s risk of acquiring HIV by changing whom they date. I exploit Zimbabwe’s efforts to control schistosomiasis, which in Southern Africa causes genital ulcers that increase susceptibility to HIV infection, in addition to malaise and fevers that limit children’s ability to learn and attend school. Because education is a major component of attractiveness in dating markets, schistosomiasis may lead young women to match with men with lower levels of schooling and a higher likelihood of having HIV. Exploiting variation in the prevalence of heavy schistosome infection among schoolchildren across districts prior to the campaign, I show that HIV prevalence among young women decreased more where schistosomiasis was more of a burden. The evidence is consistent with the schooling and dating market channel: areas that used to have higher schistosomiasis morbidity saw a greater increase in girls’ school attendance, and they date men closer to them in age and with more education.</div></li>

Health, Income, and Public Finances in a Developing Economy: Evidence from Chagas Disease Eradication in Brazi (<i>with <a href="https://www.eduardo-montero.com/">Eduardo Montero</a></i>)
  <ul>
  <li><div align="justify"><i>Abstract</i>: This paper studies the channels through which improving childhood health in a developing economy increases income in adulthood, and whether it can improve a country’s fiscal health as well. We exploit Brazil’s eradication of Chagas Disease, which has two phases: one to three months of acute illness (generally in childhood) and chronic cardiovascular problems 10 to 30 years later in a large share of those infected. We make comparisons before and after eradication across municipalities where the disease’s main vector was present and those where it was not. We show that disparities in children’s literacy and schooling decreased substantially after eradication. For adults exposed to the campaigns as children, we find increased employment and income as well as reduced reliance on anti-poverty programs as well as fertility rates. We also examine two previously-unexplored channels through which disease impacts developing economies: labor productivity&mdash;immediately after eradication (for adults with acute Chagas Disease) and in the long run (for adults with chronic symptoms)&mdash;and expenditures by Brazil’s universal public health insurance and federal pension systems.</div></li>

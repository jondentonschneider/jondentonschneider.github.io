I am a sixth-year PhD candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://lsa.umich.edu/econ "Department of Economics") and a predoctoral trainee in economic demography in the [Population Studies Center](https://www.psc.isr.umich.edu/ "Population Studies Center") at the University of Michigan. My research is in development economics and economic history with a focus on human capital, especially health, in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America.

My job market paper shows how colonial institutions shaped the HIV epidemic in Mozambique through their lasting impacts on marriage markets.

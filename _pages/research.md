<h3>Breaking Intergenerational Cycles of Poverty and Poor Health</h3>

<p>
 Disease, Disparities, and Development: Evidence from Chagas Disease Control in Brazil (<i>with <a href="https://www.eduardo-montero.com/">Eduardo Montero</a></i>)
  <blockquote>
  <i>Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) afflict the poorest billion people in the world and often cause decades-long health problems. Combating them could thus reduce inequality, the intergenerational transmission of poverty, and burdens on healthcare systems in developing countries. We show that these novel benefits of disease control resulted from Brazil's initial campaign to eliminate Chagas disease (1984-89), an NTD that occurs almost entirely among poor, non-white, and rural Latin Americans and can cause chronic heart problems. Exploiting the pre-treatment presence of its main vector, we find that having a childhood free of exposure to Chagas disease raised the adult incomes of non-white Brazilians by 1 percentile in the national distribution (2 to 4%) and their daughters' literacy rates by 0.5 percentage points (0.5%). We also estimate that, coinciding with the expected reduction in chronic Chagas disease symptoms, public spending on circulatory disease hospital care declined by 16%, contributing to an internal rate of return of 16% and an infinite marginal value of public funds. These results suggest that NTD control can reduce (racial) disparities and help to break intergenerational cycles of poverty in one of the world's most unequal regions while improving the public and fiscal health of developing economies.</i>

  Rags to Rags: The Intergenerational Effects of Ending Cash Transfers in Victorian Britain (<i>with <a href="https://www.jennifer-mayo.com/">Jennifer Mayo</a></i>)
  <blockquote>
  <i>We study the intergenerational impacts of cash transfers using the 1834 ("New") Poor Law, which drastically cut the income support that had been provided to 15 percent of the population in England and Wales and cost 2 percent of GDP. We show that in 1861, cohorts more exposed to income-support declines in childhood held lower-skilled jobs as adults and had fewer of their children in school. Linking these sons to the 1901 census, we find the same results for them as adults and for their children, highlighting the importance of accounting for multi-generational effects in cost-benefit analyses of social programs.</i>

  <blockquote>
  <i>Nearly one-third of new HIV infections in Sub-Saharan Africa occur in young women, largely because their partners are from high-prevalence groups. Since marriage market matching is shaped by human capital, which is influenced by childhood health, can deworming girls lower their chances of contracting HIV as young women? To answer this question, I study Zimbabwe’s school-based deworming program (2012-17), which substantially reduced rates of urogenital schistosomiasis. Using a difference-in-differences design, I find that 3 years after it began, young women’s HIV prevalence fell 2.7 percentage points (p.p., 44 percent) more in high-schistosomiasis districts. Human capital’s effects on marriage market matching appear to explain the results: young women’s secondary school attendance rose 6.0 p.p. (9 percent), and they had less age-disparate and fewer sexual partners. These results show that a cheap treatment for a common childhood disease can also slow an expensive and deadly pandemic, substantially increasing deworming’s estimated benefits.</i>

<h3>Historical and Cultural Factors That Created Disparities and Exclusion</h3>

  <blockquote>
  <i>I study the impacts of exposure to one of Africa's largest circular migration flows using an arbitrary border within Mozambique that, from 1893 to 1942, separated areas where young men were either pushed into or prevented from migrating. Counterintuitively, but consistent with historical narratives and theoretical predictions, HIV prevalence is lower today on the former migrant-sending side of the border while living standards are similar. The evidence suggests that age gaps between partners &ndash; which promote HIV's spread &ndash; have long been smaller in this region, as circular migration allowed much younger men to afford the requisite marriage payments to brides' families.

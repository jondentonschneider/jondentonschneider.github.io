<p>
I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at <a href="https://www.clarku.edu/departments/economics/">Clark University</a>. I earned my PhD in 2022 from the University of Michigan.
</p>

<p>
My <a href="https://jondentonschneider.com/research">research</a> is in development economics and economic history with a focus on human capital&mdash;especially health&mdash;in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. In my work, I show:
 <ul>
  <li>Mozambique's colonial history shapes its HIV epidemic.</li>
  <li>Controlling disease in developing countries has important economic impacts beyond increasing children's schooling.</li>
</ul> 
</p>

<p>
I <a href="https://jondentonschneider.com/teaching">teach</a> development economics at the graduate and undergraduate levels as well as principles courses. In teaching evaluations:
 <ul>
  <li>Undergraduates rated my instructor effectiveness as 4.92/5 (0.55 SD above the Clark mean for undergrad classes), and a student described me as "one of the best professors [they] have had in the major."</li>
  <li>Graduate students rated my course's contributions to their capacity to think critically and formulate questions as 5/5 (0.63 SD above the Clark mean for grad classes) and my success in setting and maintaining high standards for their work as 5/5 (0.55 SD above the Clark mean for grad classes).</li>
</ul>
</p>
    
<p>
As an <a href="https://jondentonschneider.com/personal">openly gay</a> economist, I work to increase inclusion in the profession as a mentor in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/csqiep-mentoring">CSQIEP LGBTQ+ Mentorship Program</a>. I did the same in college sports as an out NCAA Division I student-athlete on the University of Arizona Men's Swimming Team.

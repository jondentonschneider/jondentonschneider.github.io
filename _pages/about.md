<p>
I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at <a href="https://www.clarku.edu/departments/economics/">Clark University</a>. I earned my PhD in 2022 from the University of Michigan, where I was a predoctoral trainee in economic demography in the Population Studies Center.
</p>

<p>
My <a href="https://jondentonschneider.com/research">research</a> is in development economics and economic history with a focus on human capital&mdash;especially health&mdash;in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. In my work, I show how Mozambique's colonial history shapes its HIV epidemic and that controlling disease in developing countries has important economic impacts beyond increasing children's schooling.
</p>

<p>
I hold an MA in Latin American Studies from the University of Arizona and taught Spanish while earning my degree, an experience that informs <a href="https://jondentonschneider.com/teaching">how I teach economics</a>. In course evaluations at Clark, I received an instructor effectiveness rating of 4.92/5 (0.55 SD above the university mean of 4.44), and a student described me as "one of the best professors [they] have had in the major."

<p>
I was also an undergraduate at Arizona, where I competed for the Men's Swimming Team as an <a href="https://jondentonschneider.com/personal">openly gay NCAA Division I student-athlete</a> and worked to increase LGBTQ inclusion in college athletics. I currently serve as a mentor in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/csqiep-mentoring">CSQIEP LGBTQ+ Mentorship Program</a>.

<p>
I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at <a href="https://www.clarku.edu/departments/economics/">Clark University</a>. I earned my PhD from the University of Michigan in 2022.
</p>

<h3>Research</h3>

<p>
My <a href="https://jondentonschneider.com/research">research</a> is in economic development, health economics, and economic history. I study 2 main questions:
  <ol>
    <li>What policies have successfully broken intergenerational cycles of poverty and poor health in developing countries, both past and present?</li>
    <li>What are the historical and cultural factors that created them in the first place?</li>
  </ol>
I collect novel historical and geographical data that I use for causal identification in large administrative datasets to test hypotheses generated by economic theory as well as anthropologists, historians, public health scholars, and sociologists.
</p>


<h3>Teaching</h3>

<p>
I <a href="https://jondentonschneider.com/teaching">teach</a> development economics at the graduate and undergraduate levels as well as principles courses. In teaching evaluations:
 <ul>
   <li>Graduate students rated my course's contributions to increasing their capacity to think critically and formulate questions as 5/5 (0.63 SD above the university mean for grad classes).</li>
   <li>Undergraduates rated my instructor effectiveness as 4.92/5 (0.55 SD above the university mean for undergrad classes), and a student described me as "one of the best professors [they] have had in the major."</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>LGBTQ+ Inclusion</h3>
    
<p>
As an <a href="https://jondentonschneider.com/personal">openly gay</a> economist, I work to increase inclusion in the profession as a mentor in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/csqiep-mentoring">CSQIEP LGBTQ+ Mentorship Program</a>. I did the same in college sports as an out NCAA Division I student-athlete on the University of Arizona Men's Swimming Team.

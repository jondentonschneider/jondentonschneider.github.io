<p>
I am a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/econ">Department of Economics</a> and a predoctoral trainee in economic demography in the <a href="https://www.psc.isr.umich.edu/">Population Studies Center</a> at the University of Michigan. I will be joining <a href="https://www.clarku.edu/departments/economics/">Clark University</a> as an assistant professor in Fall 2022. My CV is <a href="https://jondentonschneider.com/files/denton-schneider_cv.pdf">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
My research is in development economics and economic history with a focus on human capital&mdash;especially health&mdash;in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. In my <a href="https://jondentonschneider.com/files/denton-schneider_institutions_hiv.pdf">job market paper</a>, I show how colonial institutions shaped the HIV epidemic in Mozambique through their lasting impacts on marriage and dating markets. In <a href="https://jondentonschneider.com/research">my other work</a>, I examine the effects of infectious disease eradication in childhood on young women's HIV prevalence in Zimbabwe and on adult income, labor productivity, and public finances in Brazil.

<p>
I hold an MA in <a href="https://las.arizona.edu/">Latin American Studies</a> from the University of Arizona and taught introductory Spanish courses while earning my degree, an experience that informs <a href="https://jondentonschneider.com/teaching">how I teach economics</a>.
</p>
    
<p>
I was also an undergraduate at Arizona, where I competed for the Men's Swimming Team as an <a href="https://jondentonschneider.com/personal">openly gay NCAA Division I student-athlete</a> and worked to increase LGBTQ inclusion in college athletics.

I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://lsa.umich.edu/econ "Department of Economics") and a predoctoral trainee in economic demography in the [Population Studies Center](https://www.psc.isr.umich.edu/ "Population Studies Center") at the University of Michigan. My research is in development economics and economic history with a focus on human capital, especially health, in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America.

My [job market paper](research) shows how colonial institutions shaped the HIV epidemic in Mozambique through their lasting impacts on marriage and dating markets. In [my other research](research), I examine the effects of infectious disease eradication during childhood on adult income, health, labor productivity, marriage, and public expenditures.

I hold an MA in [Latin American Studies](https://las.arizona.edu/) from the University of Arizona, where I [taught Spanish courses](teaching) and was an undergraduate. I also competed for the Men's Swimming Team as an [openly gay NCAA Division I student-athlete](personal).

I am on the job market in 2021-22 and will be available for interviews.

<p align="justify">
I am a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/econ">Department of Economics</a> and a predoctoral trainee in economic demography in the <a href="https://www.psc.isr.umich.edu/">Population Studies Center</a> at the University of Michigan. My research is in development economics and economic history with a focus on human capital, especially health, in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America.

My <a href="https://jondentonschneider/com/research">research</a> shows how colonial institutions shaped the HIV epidemic in Mozambique through their lasting impacts on marriage and dating markets. In <a href="https://jondentonschneider/com/research">my other projects</a>, I examine the effects of infectious disease eradication during childhood on adult income, health, labor productivity, marriage, and public expenditures.

I hold an MA in <a href="https://las.arizona.edu/">Latin American Studies</a> from the University of Arizona and taught Spanish courses, an experience that informs <a href="https://jondentonschneider.com/teaching">how I teach economics</a>. I was also an undergraduate at Arizona, where I competed for the Men's Swimming Team as an <a href="https://jondentonschneider.com/personal">openly gay NCAA Division I student-athlete</a> and worked to increase inclusion in college sports.

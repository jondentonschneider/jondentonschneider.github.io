I [swam for the University of Arizona](https://arizonawildcats.com/sports/mens-swimming-and-diving/roster/jon-denton-schneider/4190) and came out as gay to my team while competing. I wrote about my experience in an essay for [*Outsports*](https://www.outsports.com/2015/7/14/8938045/jon-denton-schneider-arizona-swimming-gay-coming-out).

I also worked to promote inclusion in college sports by organizing seminars within the Athletics Department and leading an initiative that resulted in over 150 student-athletes and staff declaring their public support for every member of the Arizona Wildcat Family.

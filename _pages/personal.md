I was an <a href="https://www.outsports.com/2015/7/14/8938045/jon-denton-schneider-arizona-swimming-gay-coming-out">out gay NCAA Division I swimmer</a> on the top-ranked team at the University of Arizona.

I used my platform to promote inclusion in college sports by organizing seminars within the Athletics Department and leading an initiative that resulted in over 150 student-athletes and staff publicly committing to supporting all Arizona Wildcats.
